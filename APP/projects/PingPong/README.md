# Ping Pong Game using AVR Microcontroller and LCD Display

This project implements a simple ping pong game using an AVR microcontroller, an LCD display, and external interrupts. The game consists of two players, each controlling a "rocket" to bounce a ball back and forth.

## Hardware Requirements
  - **AVR microcontroller (e.g., ATmega32)**:
  - **LCD display (16x2)**:
  - **Push buttons for player control**:
  - **Breadboard and jumper wires**:

## Software Requirements

  - **AVR-GCC**: compiler.
  - **AVRDUDE**: for flashing the microcontroller.
  - **AVR development environment**: (e.g., Eclipse).

## How to Play

  Connect the hardware according to the circuit diagram.
  Compile and flash the code onto the microcontroller.
  Use the push buttons to control the rockets.
  The ball will bounce between the rockets. Each time a player misses the ball, the opponent          scores a point.
  The game ends after a predefined number of turns, and the player with the highest score wins.
  
## Features
  - **Two-player game**:
  - **Score tracking**:
  - **Basic collision detection**:

## Future Improvements
  -**Add sound effects**:
  -**Implement a game over screen**:
  -**Improve collision detection and ball physics**:
